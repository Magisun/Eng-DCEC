GF loader is designed to automatically add words to the lexicon that the GF files uses. 


To do so:

1. move the text files in "Word Copies/Loader copies" to the GF_package directory 
(or wherever loader.py, input.txt, DECEExt_o.gf, and EngExt.gf)

2. Put any words into input.txt and at least one "." at the end. 
If you are using sentences, delimit the end of each sentence with "."

3. Run loader.py; DCECExt.gf and EngExt.gf will be created

4. Replace DCECExt.gf and EngExt.gf in GF Files

5. Compile GF Files
