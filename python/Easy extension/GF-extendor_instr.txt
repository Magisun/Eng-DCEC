GF_extendor will automatically add to both DCECExt.gf and EngExt.gf

As of now, GF_exendor only supports adding one type of words at a time (do not try to do say both agents.txt and binary ActionTypes in the same go).

To use GF_extendor:

1. Add words to input.txt with fomat word1,word2,word3,... (do not forget final comma after last word) 
	i.e. (to add agents) copy agents.txt to input.txt

2. Run GF_exendor.py with respective word type 

3. Replace old DCECExt.gf and EngExt.gf with new version generated by GF_extendor.py

4. Recompile GF files
